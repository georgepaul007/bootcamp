# Bootcamp: Application Software Track
Welcome to the application software track of the bootcamp. In the next few weeks, we will be developing a working web server from scratch in C/C++. 

For this track, you should be familiar with the following concepts: socket programming, multi-threading, and performance testing. Ideally, you should be familiar with all the topics in our NPTEL course [Design and Engineering of Computer Systems](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/decs/). At the very least, you should be comfortable with lectures 5-8, 18, 21, 24, 26, 31-33. You can also refer to lectures 1-3, 12-14, 33 from our OS course [Lectures on Operating Systems](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/).

After completing the warmup exercises of week 1, please follow the exercises given here from week 2 onwards.
