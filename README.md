This repository has detailed listing of weekly exercises for the 6-week bootcamp. The bootcamp has two tracks. In the application software track, we will build a simple web server from scratch in C/C++. In the OS internals track, we will understand OS concepts by adding features to the xv6 operating system. The first week of the bootcamp will consist of warmup exercises for both tracks.

Note that all discussions for exercises are on Piazza and Webex. Please lookup for instructions via email on registered email addresses.

Weekly (online) meetings are scheduled Mondays and Thursdays 5:30pm to 6:30pm for live interaction.
